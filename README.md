# Calculate-Precipitation-based-Agricultural-Drought-Indices-with-Python
Precipitation-based indices are generally considered as the simplest indices because they are calculated solely based on long-term rainfall records that are often available.  

The mostly used precipitation-based indices consist of  
- Decile Index (DI) 
- Hutchinson Drought Severity Index (HDSI) 
- Percen of Normal Index (PNI) 
- Z-Score Index (ZSI) 
- China-Z Index (CZI) 
- Modified China-Z Index (MCZI) 
- Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI) 
- Effective Drought Index (EDI) 
- Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
